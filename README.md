# ServerSide CA1

## Introduction
This is a simple web application that allows users to create and read data from database based on the website functionality.
At the same time this is a school project that I have to do for my server side programming module.

## What I use to build this website
I used html, css, Javascript, php, mysql(database) to build this website. I used Xampp to run the website locally and used school server for hosting.

## Getting Started
1. Install Xampp
2. Clone the repository into the htdocs folder
3. Start the Apache and MySQL server
4. Open the browser and type in localhost/phpmyadmin
5. Import the sql file into database.
6. Add a new folder name anything you want
7. Open the browser and type in localhost/yourfoldername
8. The website should be up and running
